Description:
   We present observations of three regions in the constellation Taurus taken 
   at 323 and 608 MHz (90 and 50 cm, respectively) with the Giant Metrewave 
   Radio Telescope (GMRT), in particular towards the molecular cloud complex 
   where there are active sites of star formation. Three pointings were 
   observed as part of a pathfinder project, targeted at the young stellar 
   objects (YSOs) L1551 IRS 5, T Tau and DG Tau (the results for these target 
   sources were presented in a previous paper). In this paper, we search for 
   other YSOs and present a survey comprising of all three fields; a by-product 
   of the large instantaneous field of view of the GMRT. The resolution of the 
   survey is of order 10 arcsec and the best rms noise at the centre of each 
   pointing is of order 100 uJy at 323 MHz and 50 uJy at 608 MHz. We present 
   a catalogue of 1815 and 687 field sources detected above 5 sigma at 323 and 
   608 MHz, respectively. A total of 440 sources were detected at both 
   frequencies, corresponding to a total unique source count of 2062 sources. 
   We compare the results with previous surveys and showcase a sample of 
   extended extragalactic objects. Although no further YSOs were detected in 
   addition to the target YSOs based on our source finding criteria, these data 
   can be useful for targeted manual searches, studies of radio galaxies or to 
   assist in the calibration of future observations with the Low Frequency Array 
   (LOFAR) towards these regions.
